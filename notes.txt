In the exercise writeup, "how confident are you in your fix?" makes me question my
confidence in my fix. 

From exercise 1, I was somewhat familiar with what I needed to do to update the golden
data, and from last week's Sunday session, I knew what bug we were looking for and what
caused it.

I initially thought I could simply fix the bug by moving the players.push_back() call
to after initializing the first elements in places, purses, and inPenaltyBox. This would
have made players.size() == 0 when configuring the vectors for the first player added,
which would have fixed the off by one error. But then I noticed the sneaky vector 
initialization when calling the Game() constructor. 

I think this would have caused bugs in the code in one of two ways:
1. If more than 6 players were added, the player configuration syntax would not work
   and new players' places, purses, and inPenaltyBox would not be initialized properly.
2. Changing the player configuration syntax to use push_back() would make places, 
   purses, and inPenaltyBox begin with 6 zeros then it would begin adding the new 
   elements.

I chose to use push_back() to configure the new players, and also removed the vector
initialization when the Game() constructor is called.
